PROBLEM STATEMENT/PURPOSE: Design a project from scratch to provide an online notes sharing plate form.

OUR IDEA: An idea to develop a server-client based project which provides either of the server or client to upload and download various notes, previous year exam papers and pdfs of various recommended books using same platform.

IMPLEMENTATION/OVERALL DESCRIPTION: We had realised our idea through our online platform named “NOTESFERRY: Notes for amigos” which is basically a WebApp. 
		Basically we had designed a WebApp which first provides the user a GUI ,through which he can oversee the required notes or other stuff by entering and clicking various tiles and check boxes according to their requirement. After that they may download the file of their choice out of all displayed files. A user may also upload his/her own notes or other material after proper validation by the admin.

TOOLS USED:
•	Front-end: We had used Html-5 ,Css-3 and Bootstrap-4 to design GUI which will take user from one web page to other and allow them to access the file of their requirement.

Tool: Sublime text 3 Editor
Dependency: Bootstrap 4 CDN.

•	Back-end: We had used Node.js as a back-end tool which is used to develop our server system which will help us in fetching the intended file according to users requirement from collection of many files.

Tool: Visual Studio Editor	
Modules Used: Express , Path and  fs.
